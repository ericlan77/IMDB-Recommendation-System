# A simple movie recommendation system

## Overview
It's the final project of [Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender/home/welcome) in Cousera.

You can click [this link](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//capstone/recommender.php?id=b15dByLiNFfSuv) to see the page, which will offer you 10 random movies from IMDB to rate.

After submitting your ratings, the system will offer you several movies(10 at most) that most fit your taste based on the database of IMDB. But I have set some threshold so that sometimes there will no be less 10 movies to show.
